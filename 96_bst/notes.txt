DISCO
search()
- tree traversal with included target checks embedded

height()
 - returns the longest chain of parent-child relationships
 - (+1 accounts for the root itself)

numLeaves()
- kinda like a traversal except just notes each "dead end"

- All use a basic recursive technique, with similar applications

QCC
- considering the usual methods for a data structure, how would one delete an element? would you ever need to anyways?
- how does the algo treat 2 equal integers?
