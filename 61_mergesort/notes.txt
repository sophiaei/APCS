HW60 -- A Termite is-a Turtle, a Thinker is-a Turtle / Observing an Algo
2022-02-07m
Time spent: 0.25 hrs

DISCO:
- Outsourcing can help solve possible problems faster. Essentially divides the work amongst multiple persons.
- If you don't know the current status of the deck, simplify it.
- Build incrementally(?) from basic sorted deck (1 card) until sorted deck.

QCC:

THINKER FIRMWARE
- GIVE: During original distribution, if cards > 1, half and give both resulting decks to two others. Else, give card to person where you got it from.
- TAKE: If hands == empty or if originally distributed set of halved cards.
