- was very confused re: the actual rules of looking or not looking at the cards

THINKER FIRMWEAR
- when given cards, split into two decks and pass to 2 other people.
  - do not take any more cards except for those originally given to you
- when 2 sorted decks return to you, merge sort them and give to the person
 who gave them to you.
