time spent: 0.5 hrs

Activity 6:
1. 5 of spades and 6 of clubs, 5 of clubs and 6 of clubs
2. Yes, because there are a total of 12 face cards and they must be taken out 3
at a time. All others are paired up. Therefore if there are 3 cards left, they
must be face cards, or else something was paired incorrectly.
3. No, because when presented with both choices, they can both be taken.
