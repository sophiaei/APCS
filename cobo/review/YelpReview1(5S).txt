All that and a bag of APPLES!!! One of the best schools, with the best instructors. TSMMA Bayside delivered everything that was promised and more.  

Before our son started. My husband and I were deeply concerned with the lack of focus, confidence, drive and coordination our son had. This was a genuine concern. So we search for a karate school with the hopes this would help. We must have been to 5 different schools in our area. Each one felt made us feel like a cash cows.  Go in, pay, train and leave with very few class options. Until we found TSMMA Bayside. We had our son try out a class. Our son had no idea what karate even was but his sensei walked him through every step of the way. At the end of class they would have all of the kids sit and would basically talk to them as a class to encourage & motivate them. SOLD!!!! The fact that it's not just only about the training but about the overall development as a person is what got us. 4 years and counting!

I've personally, have recently joined to better my own health. The overall classes are well structured and just a lot of fun. The fact that they have a lot of classes throughout the day and even on weekends helps because It's a "must" that I have enough time to spend with my family.

Above all this school cares. They foster a lot of family values like honesty, encouragement, and the ability to keep going when things get tough. I would definitely recommend this school to anyone.
