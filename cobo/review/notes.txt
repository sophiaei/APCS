Here be my notes

ACT.1

1.a public static double sentimentVal( String word )

1b. Yes, it requires a String parameter.
  -> It will return a incompatible type error.

1.c. Yes, the method returns a double.

2. In Review.java main method

3.
  a.
  double num = sentimentVal("warm");
  - yes, sentimentVal returns a double.

  b.
  String word =  sentimentVal(0.5);
  - no, will get an incompatible type Error

  c.
  double x = sentimentVal("good", "bad");
  - no, will get an error re: too many parameters given


ACT.2
4. Total sentiment works by iterating through the String array words, and adding
    every sentiment value to a "total", which is returned.

5. The ratings don't make much sense, seeing as the reviews are both good, and yet the ratings are 1 and 2, so fairly inaccurate.
