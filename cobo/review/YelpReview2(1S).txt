I wish I would've read these reviews before I signed up. It would've told me everything I needed to know. I signed up my five-year-old son for classes long story short he is not happy and does not like it . He cries hysterically at the mere mention of going. In the 2 months since he signed up he has missed 7 classes . Twice a week he had a class so that's 8classes a month. He only attended 9 out of the 16. The classes he did attend I had to bribe him to get him there...after expressing this issue to them, which they visually saw with their own eyes. every class he attended he was not interested nor was he interacting with the class. They wouldn't even assist him or help him. He would just sit there with his eyes wondering around the room. No one payed any attention to him. (That's a whole separate issue) They are refusing to issue me a refund as if the contract was set in stone. I was even willing to pay for 3 months and uniforms and take the difference. They refused to accommodate me. Instead they recommended I pass the account down to a friend or family member. The money was more important to them than the child's happiness or level of comfort. Let me also mention the overcrowding . It's impossible to give individual attention with 40 students on the mat. It's very disappointing. I will never recommend tiger SHULMANS To anyone that I know and I will spend the next couple of weeks on my social media platforms making sure I encourage others to avoid this place at all cost...They just want your money. AVOID THIS PLACE!!!!!!
